### Architecture & Security

| # | Area | Description | Priority | Found |
|---|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 49 | Infra | Delete old Supabase project (`vvsmxzebaoslofigxakt`, eu-west-1) — migrated to new project (`hwagqyywixhhorhjtydt`, eu-central-1) via Vercel integration. Delete once confident everything works. | Low | 2026-04-22 |
| 55 | Architecture | Wartungen + edit customer pages use `useEffect` data fetching instead of React Query — violates established hook pattern. Migrate to `useQuery` hooks. | Medium | 2026-04-22 |
| 56 | Architecture | `MaintenanceHistory`, `MaintenanceChecklistModal`, `BookingFormModal` use direct `fetch()` instead of React Query mutations — should use `useMutation` hooks for consistency and cache invalidation. | Medium | 2026-04-22 |
| 57 | Security | Follow-ups and checklist-items DELETE routes use `requireAuth()` instead of `requireOwner()` — TECHNICIAN can delete records. Align with permission matrix (delete = OWNER only). | High | 2026-04-22 |
| 58 | Security | Cal.com webhook HMAC verification fails open when `CAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` env var is unset — should reject all requests if secret is missing. | High | 2026-04-22 |
| 59 | Infra | In-memory rate limiter (`Map`) resets on every cold start — no-op on Vercel serverless. Migrate to Upstash Redis for persistent rate limiting. | Medium | 2026-04-22 |
| 60 | Architecture | `CatalogPicker` "Ändern" button passes `entries[0]` to `onChange` when clearing — semantically incorrect. `onChange` signature should support `null` entry for clear action. | Low | 2026-04-22 |

### Workload & Scheduling — Upcoming Features

| # | Area | Description | Priority | Found |
|---|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 62 | Feature | Termine page — full `/dashboard/termine` with list + monthly calendar view, filters (time/status/technician/customer/system/source), in-app reschedule + cancel via Cal.com v2 API, customer notification emails, source icon + legend. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-23-termine-page-design.md`. Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-23-termine-page.md`. Includes fixing #58 (HMAC fail-open) since it touches the same webhook. | High | 2026-04-23 |

### System Model — Follow-up

| # | Area | Description | Priority | Found |
|---|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 34 | Feature | Photos per system — allow attaching up to 5 photos per system directly in system detail view (e.g. installation photos for quoting). | Medium | 2026-04-16 |

### Cal.com Booking Integration

Booking is functional (webhook + customer resolution + system link + Terminiert badge). One follow-up remains.

| # | Area | Description | Priority | Found |
|---|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 33 | Feature | Multi-system booking — if a customer has multiple systems with the same maintenance interval, allow selecting all for a single appointment. | Medium | 2026-04-16 |

### Cal.com Configuration

Generic "Wartungstermin" event type configured (60 min, Mon–Fri 7:30–17:00). Per-system-type event types deferred until pilot feedback.

| # | Area | Description | Priority | Found |
|---|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 42 | Config | Per-system-type event durations — different Cal.com event types per system type (Wärmepumpe, Gas, Öl, etc.) if pilot customer needs it. Deferred until feedback. | Low | 2026-04-16 |
| 44 | Config | Target email — booking confirmation currently goes to personal email. Change to business address when available. | Low | 2026-04-16 |
| 45 | Config | Cancellation flow — verify Cal.com cancellation link is included in confirmation email so customers can cancel directly. | Low | 2026-04-16 |
| 51 | Decision | Cal.com multi-tenant strategy — current single-account setup doesn't scale beyond pilot. Options: Cal.com Teams, per-user Cal.com accounts, or custom booking UI via Cal.com API. Decide post-pilot. | Low | 2026-04-22 |
| 52 | Testing | Test full booking flow end-to-end — customer receives reminder, clicks Cal.com link, books, webhook fires, booking appears in torqr dashboard. | Medium | 2026-04-22 |
| 11 | Decision | Calendar integration strategy — recommendation: do NOT build own calendar. Use Cal.com for scheduling, let users sync to Google/Outlook via Cal.com. Embed iframe if needed later. | Low | 2026-04-14 |

## Maybe / Future

Ideas worth keeping in mind but not planned for current sprints. No implementation until explicitly decided.

| # | Area | Description | Notes |
|---|------|-------------|-------|
| M-1 | Feature | PDF / Arbeitsbericht — export a completed maintenance checklist as a PDF work report for the customer. Would require a PDF generation library (e.g. `@react-pdf/renderer`) or a server-side rendering approach. | Requested by pilot customer context. Deferred until checklist feature is validated in production. |
| M-2 | Feature | Measurement fields on checklist — allow custom checklist items to capture numeric values (e.g. flue gas temperature, pressure reading) instead of just checkboxes. | Revisit after pilot feedback. |
| M-3 | Feature | Drag-and-drop reordering of custom checklist items per `CustomerSystem`. | Low priority; `sortOrder` field is already in the schema to support this later. |

## Completed / Resolved

Items are grouped by sprint / work session, ordered newest first.

### Sprint 24 — Technician Workload Management (2026-04-23)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 61 | Feature | Technician workload management — new `AssigneeBadge` component on systems list + customer detail (OWNER only); new `/dashboard/employees/[id]` page with header, 4-tile stats grid, customer-grouped assigned systems with per-row + bulk reassign modal, and last-10 recent maintenance activity; Mitarbeiter list rows clickable with workload column + overdue pill; URL-driven `?assignee=` filter on `/dashboard/systems`; dashboard "Nicht zugewiesen" tile replacing the old orphaned-after-deactivation warning; deactivation now silently reassigns all systems to OWNER in a single transaction with a toast showing the count. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-23-technician-workload-management-design.md`. Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-23-technician-workload-management.md`. | 2026-04-23 |
| — | API | `GET /api/employees` returns per-employee `workload: { assignedSystemsCount, overdueSystemsCount }` via two parallel `customerSystem.groupBy` queries (no N+1). | 2026-04-23 |
| — | API | New `GET /api/employees/[id]` returns `{ stats, assignedSystems (grouped by customer), recentActivity }` via 6 parallel Prisma queries. | 2026-04-23 |
| — | API | `GET /api/customer-systems` now accepts `?assignee=all\|unassigned\|<uuid>` via `assigneeFilterSchema`. TECHNICIAN role always scoped to own userId regardless of param. | 2026-04-23 |
| — | API | `GET /api/dashboard/stats` replaces `unassignedAfterDeactivation` list with a single `unassignedSystemsCount` count. | 2026-04-23 |
| — | API | `PATCH /api/employees/[id]` deactivation now wraps `user.update` + `customerSystem.updateMany` (reassign to OWNER) + `session.deleteMany` in a single `$transaction`; returns `reassignedCount`. | 2026-04-23 |
| — | Hooks | `useEmployee(id)`, `useBulkReassignSystems` (Promise.allSettled with partial-success toast), plus extended `useToggleEmployee` with contextual success messaging. | 2026-04-23 |
| — | Testing | 8 new vitest cases covering employees workload, detail shape, assignee filter variants, auto-reassign transaction, self-deactivation block, reactivation. Full suite: 122/122 passing. | 2026-04-23 |
| — | Bugfix | `maintenanceCreateSchema`/`maintenanceUpdateSchema` `notes` field was rejecting `null` payloads from the client (Zod `.optional()` only accepts `undefined`). Switched to `.optional().nullable()`. | 2026-04-23 |
| — | UI | All form submit buttons standardised to `h-11` on both mobile + desktop (was `h-11 sm:h-9`, producing visual mismatch with 44 px inputs). 7 files. | 2026-04-23 |
| — | UI | Sidebar now shows "Inhaber" / "Techniker" role badge next to user name. | 2026-04-23 |

### Catalog fix & expansion (2026-04-22)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| — | Bugfix | `catalogCreateSchema` rejected `null` for `acSubtype`/`storageSubtype` (`.optional()` accepts `undefined` only) — `POST /api/catalog` returned 400 "Validierungsfehler" when adding a new heating/water entry from the CatalogPicker dialog. Switched to `.nullish()`; AC refine tightened to also reject `null`. | 2026-04-22 |
| — | Infra | Re-seeded `SystemCatalog` on the new Supabase DB (migration left it empty). Added `src/config/additional-catalog.json` with ~680 entries covering AC (346), water treatment (125), and energy storage (209, split BOILER / BUFFER_TANK). Extended `prisma/seed.ts` to upsert all four `SystemType` enums. Total catalog: 904 entries. Idempotent — re-running refreshes `storageSubtype` classification. | 2026-04-22 |
| — | Feature | `CatalogPicker` "Neues Gerät hinzufügen" form now renders a conditional subtype `<select>` when `systemType` is `AC` (Single-/Multi-Split 2–5) or `ENERGY_STORAGE` (Boiler / Pufferspeicher). `canSubmit` guard blocks submit until required subtype is chosen, so the server-side Zod refine never rejects the payload. | 2026-04-22 |

### Sprint 23 — Company Multi-User Architecture (2026-04-22)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| — | Bugfix | Vercel build failure on Next 16 / Turbopack — `src/app/admin/layout.tsx` (client) imported `isAdminEmail` from `src/lib/admin-auth.ts`, which also exported `requireAdmin` with a dynamic `import('@/lib/auth')`. Turbopack traced the dynamic import into the client bundle, pulling `next/headers` + `prisma`/`pg` (dns/net/tls/fs) into the browser. Fix: split `isAdminEmail` into `src/lib/admin-email.ts` (pure, no deps), keep `requireAdmin` in `admin-auth.ts` with a static `auth` import, convert admin layout to a server component that calls `requireAdmin()` and redirects on `Forbidden`/`Unauthorized`, and extract nav/signout into `AdminLayoutShell` client component. Also fixed a latent gating bug (client-side `process.env.ADMIN_EMAILS` was always `undefined` → admin UI was unreachable). | 2026-04-22 |
| — | Architecture | User-as-Tenant → Company-as-Tenant migration. `Company` model added. All tenant-scoped tables (`Customer`, `CustomerSystem`, `Maintenance`, `Booking`, `FollowUpJob`, `EmailLog`) now have `companyId` FK. All 19 API routes migrated from `userId` to `companyId` scoping. `userId` retained as audit field on create operations only. Full decision record: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-22-company-multi-user-architecture.md`. | 2026-04-22 |
| — | Auth | `requireAuth()` now returns `{ userId, companyId, role, email, name }`. New `requireOwner()` and `requireRole()` helpers. `UserRole` enum (OWNER, TECHNICIAN) on User model. JWT/session callbacks load role from DB on every refresh. Deactivated users get token invalidated immediately. | 2026-04-22 |
| 26 | Feature | Employee management — "Mitarbeiter" page (OWNER only). Create technician with temp password + `mustChangePassword` flag. Activate/deactivate (never delete to preserve history). `isActive` flag blocks login. Session invalidation on deactivation. `useEmployees` hook with `enabled` option. | 2026-04-22 |
| — | Feature | Technician assignment — `assignedToUserId` nullable FK on `CustomerSystem`. OWNER-only assignment via PATCH endpoint with company membership + active status validation. Dropdown on system detail page for OWNER, read-only display for TECHNICIAN. | 2026-04-22 |
| — | Feature | Role-aware dashboard — OWNER sees company-wide stats, TECHNICIAN sees "Meine Woche" (only assigned systems + own maintenances). "Unassigned after deactivation" warning card for OWNER when systems are assigned to deactivated users. | 2026-04-22 |
| — | Feature | Role-aware weekly summary — cron now iterates all active users with `emailWeeklySummary` enabled. OWNER gets company-wide data, TECHNICIAN gets only assigned systems + own maintenances. `sendWeeklySummaryToAll()` function with per-user error handling. | 2026-04-22 |
| — | Security | Permission matrix enforced — DELETE operations require `requireOwner()`. Bookings POST restricted to OWNER only. Send-reminder restricted to OWNER only. Technician assignment restricted to OWNER only. Nav items filtered by role. Delete/booking buttons hidden for TECHNICIAN. | 2026-04-22 |
| — | Feature | Company name setup modal — shown once for OWNER when `company.name` is null. Ensures company identity is set before employees are created. | 2026-04-22 |
| — | Testing | Tenant isolation audit test updated — checks all route files for `companyId` scoping (tenant routes) or `userId` scoping (user routes). Catches uncategorised new routes. Pre-existing stale entry for `sentry-example-api` removed. | 2026-04-22 |
| 53 | Feature | TECHNICIAN list filtering — `customer-systems`, `wartungen`, and `bookings` GET routes now scope to assigned systems / own bookings for TECHNICIAN role. OWNER sees all company data. Consistent with dashboard stats scoping. | 2026-04-22 |
| 54 | Feature | Must-change-password flow — `ProtectedRoute` redirects to `/dashboard/change-password` when `mustChangePassword: true`. Change-password page with validation + `POST /api/user/force-change-password` API route that sets `mustChangePassword: false`. Session refresh after change. | 2026-04-22 |
| — | Docs | CLAUDE.md updated with Company-as-Tenant isolation rules, role helpers, exception list, and multi-tenancy section. | 2026-04-22 |

### Sprint 22 — Account Cleanup + Delete Account (2026-04-22)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 48 | Cleanup | Supabase client cleanup — removed dead `uploadMaintenancePhoto()`, anon client singleton, and `supabase` convenience object. Switched `deleteMaintenancePhoto()` to use admin client (bypasses RLS). | 2026-04-22 |
| 14 | Feature | Delete account / danger zone — `DELETE /api/user/account` with password verification, Supabase storage cleanup, cascading DB delete. `DangerZoneCard` with `AlertDialog` confirmation on account page. Redirects to login after deletion. | 2026-04-22 |
| 41 | Config | Business hours — Mon–Fri 7:30–17:00 Europe/Berlin configured in Cal.com availability settings. | 2026-04-22 |
| 43 | Config | Booking location — changed from "Online Call" to "In Person (Organizer Address)" with business address. | 2026-04-22 |
| 50 | Security | RLS deny-all policies applied to all 12 public tables on new Supabase project (`hwagqyywixhhorhjtydt`). RLS was already enabled but had no explicit policies — now each table has a named `deny_all` policy. | 2026-04-22 |

### Sprint 21 — Security Hardening + Supabase Migration (2026-04-22)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| — | Security | Full credential rotation — DB password, Supabase service role key, Resend API key, Cal.com webhook secret, Sentry auth token, AUTH_SECRET, CRON_SECRET, UNSUBSCRIBE_SECRET. All Vercel env vars marked sensitive where applicable. | 2026-04-22 |
| — | Security | RLS enabled on all 13 public tables with deny-all policy. Fixes Supabase "tables publicly accessible" critical alert. All data access goes through Prisma + service role key (bypasses RLS). | 2026-04-22 |
| — | Security | Storage bucket `maintenance-photos` recreated without broad SELECT policy. Fixes "public bucket allows listing" warning. Public URLs still work, but file listing is blocked. | 2026-04-22 |
| — | Infra | Migrated to new Supabase project (`hwagqyywixhhorhjtydt`, eu-central-1) via Vercel integration. All 6 Prisma migrations applied. Storage bucket configured with 5MB limit and JPEG/PNG/WebP restriction. | 2026-04-22 |
| — | Fix | Prisma config — switched from `env()` (broken in Prisma 7 for `migrate deploy`) to `dotenv/config` import + `process.env.DIRECT_URL` fallback. Migrations now work reliably. | 2026-04-22 |
| — | Fix | SSL fix for `pg` Pool — Supabase requires SSL but `pg` library doesn't parse `sslmode` from connection string. Added explicit `ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }` to Pool constructor. | 2026-04-22 |

### Sprint 20 — Follow-Up Jobs + Installation Date Checkbox (2026-04-21)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 27 | Feature | Follow-up jobs (Nachfolgeaufträge) — `FollowUpJob` model tied to `CustomerSystem` with optional `Maintenance` back-reference. CRUD API routes, React Query hook. `FollowUpSection` on system detail page with inline add + toggle complete + delete. Follow-up creation in `MaintenanceChecklistModal` Step 2. Amber badge with open count on customer detail page system cards. | 2026-04-21 |
| 32 | Feature | Installation date = maintenance date checkbox — checkbox in `SystemAssignmentModal` copies installation date to last maintenance date field. Syncs on date change, disables field when active, restores on uncheck. Pure client-side logic. | 2026-04-21 |

### Sprint 19 — Email Rework: Weekly Summary + Editable Templates (2026-04-21)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 13 | Email | Weekly summary rethink — replaced stat-block layout with actionable section-based email: bookings this week (green), due but unbooked (amber), overdue (red), retro last week (gray), totals. 7 parallel queries, 10-item list limits with overflow. | 2026-04-21 |
| 40 | Feature | Editable email templates — `reminderGreeting` and `reminderBody` fields on User model. Placeholder `{customerName}` support. "E-Mail-Vorlage" card on account page. Empty = use defaults. | 2026-04-21 |
| 2 | Email | Email deliverability — GMX junk issue resolved. DMARC no longer necessary. | 2026-04-21 |
| — | Docs | Comprehensive email system documentation written to `docs/EMAIL-SYSTEM.md` — covers all email types, cron jobs, opt-in flow, template architecture, configuration. | 2026-04-21 |

### Sprint 18 — Digital Maintenance Checklist (2026-04-21)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 35 | Feature | Digital maintenance checklist — 3-step `MaintenanceChecklistModal` (checklist → notes/photos → confirm). Per-system-type defaults (HEATING 10, AC 7, WATER_TREATMENT 6, ENERGY_STORAGE 6 items). `CustomerSystemChecklistItem` model for custom items per system. Immutable JSON snapshot on `Maintenance.checklistData`. API routes for checklist items CRUD. Integrated into system detail, customer detail, and dashboard pages. | 2026-04-21 |

### Sprint 17 — Quick Wins: Security, Dashboard Bookings, Email Log (2026-04-21)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 47 | Security | Photo upload route now verifies `maintenanceId` ownership (`prisma.maintenance.findFirst({ where: { id, userId } })`) and scopes storage path to `{userId}/maintenances/{id}-{ts}.ext`. | 2026-04-21 |
| 10 | Feature | Dashboard "Gebuchte Termine" section — shows all upcoming CONFIRMED bookings with customer name, system label, date/time. Uses existing `useBookings()` hook. | 2026-04-21 |
| 36 | Feature | Email log card on customer detail page — `GET /api/customers/[id]/email-logs` route + `useCustomerEmailLogs` hook. Shows up to 30 sent emails with type label (German), date/time, error indicator. Hidden when no logs exist. | 2026-04-21 |

### Sprint 16 — Multi-Tenancy Architecture Decision (2026-04-21)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 15 | Decision | Shared-database, single-schema multi-tenancy confirmed. Originally `userId`-scoped; **superseded by Sprint 23** Company-as-Tenant (`companyId`-scoped). Updated decision record: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-22-company-multi-user-architecture.md`. | 2026-04-21 |

### Sprint 15 — Office-Side Booking (2026-04-21)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 38 | Feature | Office-side booking via BookingFormModal on system detail page. POST /api/bookings creates Booking with BOOKING_MANUAL trigger, auto-links customer. Sends BookingConfirmationEmail (German) if customer has email; fire-and-forget, non-blocking. | 2026-04-21 |

### Sprint 14 — Terminiert Badge + Booked Slot Display (2026-04-21)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 20 | Feature | Green "Terminiert" badge on system cards when a future CONFIRMED booking exists. Replaces urgency badge when booked. | 2026-04-21 |
| 24 | UX | Booked slot (date + time) replaces "Nächste Wartung" line on system card when booking exists. System detail page shows "Gebuchter Termin" row in Wartungsplan card. | 2026-04-21 |

### Sprint 13 — Booking ↔ System Link (2026-04-21)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 23 | Feature | `systemId` FK added to `Booking` model. Cal.com reminder URLs now embed `metadata[systemId]`. Webhook resolves and validates `systemId` against user scope before storing. `GET /api/bookings` returns system + catalog info. Unblocks #24 and #20. | 2026-04-21 |

### Sprint 12 — Email Copy Fix (2026-04-20)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 39 | Email | Reminder email rephrased — wording now correctly states "last maintenance was X weeks ago, time to rebook" instead of implying a booked appointment is approaching. Card label changed from "Geplanter Wartungstermin" → "Wartung fällig ab". | 2026-04-20 |

### Sprint 11 — System Model Overhaul (2026-04-20)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 28 | Decision | Heater model: chose **Option A** — global `SystemCatalog` + per-tenant `CustomerSystem` instances. Catalog is shared across users; customer assignment is per-tenant with `userId` scoping. | 2026-04-20 |
| 29 | Feature | Renamed "Heizsysteme" → "Systeme". New `SystemCatalog` (global) + `CustomerSystem` (per-tenant) models. Top-level type selector: Heizung / Klimaanlage / Wasseraufbereitung / Energiespeicher. `SystemAssignmentModal` with `SystemTypeSelector` + `CatalogPicker` (search, grouped by manufacturer, inline add). Catalog seeded with 224 heating entries. New `/dashboard/systems` list page + `/dashboard/systems/[id]` detail page. | 2026-04-20 |
| 30 | Feature | AC subtypes — `AcSubtype` enum (SINGLE_SPLIT, MULTI_SPLIT_2/3/4/5) added to schema and `catalogCreateSchema`. | 2026-04-20 |
| 31 | Feature | Energy storage subtypes — `StorageSubtype` enum (BOILER, BUFFER_TANK) and `storageCapacityLiters` field added to `CustomerSystem`. | 2026-04-20 |
| 46 | Cleanup | Old `heatingType` / `additionalEnergySources` / `energyStorageSystems` fields removed from `Customer` model and all forms. Old `Heater` model, `useHeaters` hook, `HeaterFormModal`, `heater-form/` components, `api/heaters/`, `api/heating-systems/`, `dashboard/heaters/` all deleted. | 2026-04-20 |

### Sprint 10 — Admin Panel (2026-04-17)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 7 | Feature | Platform admin panel at `/admin` — gated by `ADMIN_EMAILS` env var. Read-only. Overview stats, paginated user list with search + last login, user detail drill-down (profile, customers, email log), email log with type filter, cron run monitor. `requireAdmin()` helper with unit tests. Admin button in account page visible only to admin users. | 2026-04-17 |

### Sprint 9 — Cal.com E2E + Bug Fixes (2026-04-16)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 18 | Bug | Photo uploader fixed — client-side anon key rejected by Supabase RLS (no Supabase session via NextAuth). Moved to server-side `POST /api/upload/photo` using `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. | 2026-04-16 |
| 21a | Email | "Wartungstermin" label renamed to "Geplanter Wartungstermin" in reminder email template. | 2026-04-16 |
| 21b | UX | Per-heater reminder send button — mail icon per heater row on customer detail page; sends reminder for that specific heater. Sidebar generic button removed. | 2026-04-16 |
| 21c | Feature | Cal.com booking URL pre-fills customer name, email, and address (`location` param). | 2026-04-16 |

### Sprint 8 — Mobile Responsiveness (2026-04-16)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 6 | UX | Full mobile responsiveness — all pages, modals, forms. iOS auto-zoom fix (`text-base` on inputs), 44px touch targets, responsive button rows, export buttons hidden on mobile. | 2026-04-16 |

### Sprint 7 — Bugs & UX Fixes (2026-04-16)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 16 | Bug | Customer not shown after creation — fixed via `useCreateCustomer` hook. | 2026-04-16 |
| 17 | Bug | Heater not shown after creation — fixed by invalidating `['heaters']` cache. | 2026-04-16 |
| 19 | Feature | Customer email field made required with asterisk and validation. | 2026-04-16 |
| 21 | Feature | Maintenance notes field made required with asterisk and error message. | 2026-04-16 |
| 22 | UX | Customer quick-actions spacing improved. | 2026-04-16 |

### Sprint 6 — Account & Settings Page (2026-04-16)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 5 | Feature | Account page — change password, update profile, manage settings. Avatar chip links to `/dashboard/account`. | 2026-04-16 |
| 8 | Feature | Profile fields — name, phone, email, password, companyName. Phone + companyName appear in reminder email footer. | 2026-04-16 |
| 9 | Email | `companyName` field added to User model — appears in reminder email sign-off. | 2026-04-16 |

### Sprint 5 — Cal.com Webhook Integration (2026-04-14)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |

## Open Items

### Architecture & Security

| # | Area | Description | Priority | Found |
|---|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 50 | Security | Re-apply RLS deny-all policies on new Supabase project (`hwagqyywixhhorhjtydt`). Tables show "UNRESTRICTED" — Sprint 21 RLS was applied to old project only. Not blocking (Prisma + service role bypasses RLS), but needed for defense-in-depth. | High | 2026-04-22 |
| 49 | Infra | Delete old Supabase project (`vvsmxzebaoslofigxakt`, eu-west-1) — migrated to new project (`hwagqyywixhhorhjtydt`, eu-central-1) via Vercel integration. Delete once confident everything works. | Low | 2026-04-22 |

### System Model — Follow-up

| # | Area | Description | Priority | Found |
|---|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 34 | Feature | Photos per system — allow attaching up to 5 photos per system directly in system detail view (e.g. installation photos for quoting). | Medium | 2026-04-16 |

### Cal.com Booking Integration

Booking is functional (webhook + customer resolution + system link + Terminiert badge). One follow-up remains.

| # | Area | Description | Priority | Found |
|---|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 33 | Feature | Multi-system booking — if a customer has multiple systems with the same maintenance interval, allow selecting all for a single appointment. | Medium | 2026-04-16 |

### Cal.com Configuration

Generic "Wartungstermin" event type configured (60 min, Mon–Fri 7:30–17:00). Per-system-type event types deferred until pilot feedback.

| # | Area | Description | Priority | Found |
|---|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 42 | Config | Per-system-type event durations — different Cal.com event types per system type (Wärmepumpe, Gas, Öl, etc.) if pilot customer needs it. Deferred until feedback. | Low | 2026-04-16 |
| 44 | Config | Target email — booking confirmation currently goes to personal email. Change to business address when available. | Low | 2026-04-16 |
| 45 | Config | Cancellation flow — verify Cal.com cancellation link is included in confirmation email so customers can cancel directly. | Low | 2026-04-16 |
| 51 | Decision | Cal.com multi-tenant strategy — current single-account setup doesn't scale beyond pilot. Options: Cal.com Teams, per-user Cal.com accounts, or custom booking UI via Cal.com API. Decide post-pilot. | Low | 2026-04-22 |
| 52 | Testing | Test full booking flow end-to-end — customer receives reminder, clicks Cal.com link, books, webhook fires, booking appears in torqr dashboard. | Medium | 2026-04-22 |
| 11 | Decision | Calendar integration strategy — recommendation: do NOT build own calendar. Use Cal.com for scheduling, let users sync to Google/Outlook via Cal.com. Embed iframe if needed later. | Low | 2026-04-14 |

### Workforce & Scheduling

Relevant once multiple employees are on the platform.

| # | Area | Description | Priority | Found |
|---|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 26 | Feature | Employee management — "Mitarbeiter" tab. Create/delete employees. Show weekly maintenance count per employee and historical workload. | Medium | 2026-04-16 |
| 37 | Feature | Technician calendar view — which technician has appointments when. Admin can enter vacation / sick days. Sick day triggers automated rebook email to affected customers. | Medium | 2026-04-16 |

### Data Import

| # | Area | Description | Priority | Found |
|---|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 25 | Feature | CSV/Excel customer import — import customers from external tools (e.g. Tooltime export). Map columns to Customer model fields. | Medium | 2026-04-16 |

## Maybe / Future

Ideas worth keeping in mind but not planned for current sprints. No implementation until explicitly decided.

| # | Area | Description | Notes |
|---|------|-------------|-------|
| M-1 | Feature | PDF / Arbeitsbericht — export a completed maintenance checklist as a PDF work report for the customer. Would require a PDF generation library (e.g. `@react-pdf/renderer`) or a server-side rendering approach. | Requested by pilot customer context. Deferred until checklist feature is validated in production. |
| M-2 | Feature | Measurement fields on checklist — allow custom checklist items to capture numeric values (e.g. flue gas temperature, pressure reading) instead of just checkboxes. | Revisit after pilot feedback. |
| M-3 | Feature | Drag-and-drop reordering of custom checklist items per `CustomerSystem`. | Low priority; `sortOrder` field is already in the schema to support this later. |

## Completed / Resolved

Items are grouped by sprint / work session, ordered newest first.

### Sprint 22 — Account Cleanup + Delete Account (2026-04-22)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 48 | Cleanup | Supabase client cleanup — removed dead `uploadMaintenancePhoto()`, anon client singleton, and `supabase` convenience object. Switched `deleteMaintenancePhoto()` to use admin client (bypasses RLS). | 2026-04-22 |
| 14 | Feature | Delete account / danger zone — `DELETE /api/user/account` with password verification, Supabase storage cleanup, cascading DB delete. `DangerZoneCard` with `AlertDialog` confirmation on account page. Redirects to login after deletion. | 2026-04-22 |
| 41 | Config | Business hours — Mon–Fri 7:30–17:00 Europe/Berlin configured in Cal.com availability settings. | 2026-04-22 |
| 43 | Config | Booking location — changed from "Online Call" to "In Person (Organizer Address)" with business address. | 2026-04-22 |

### Sprint 21 — Security Hardening + Supabase Migration (2026-04-22)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| — | Security | Full credential rotation — DB password, Supabase service role key, Resend API key, Cal.com webhook secret, Sentry auth token, AUTH_SECRET, CRON_SECRET, UNSUBSCRIBE_SECRET. All Vercel env vars marked sensitive where applicable. | 2026-04-22 |
| — | Security | RLS enabled on all 13 public tables with deny-all policy. Fixes Supabase "tables publicly accessible" critical alert. All data access goes through Prisma + service role key (bypasses RLS). | 2026-04-22 |
| — | Security | Storage bucket `maintenance-photos` recreated without broad SELECT policy. Fixes "public bucket allows listing" warning. Public URLs still work, but file listing is blocked. | 2026-04-22 |
| — | Infra | Migrated to new Supabase project (`hwagqyywixhhorhjtydt`, eu-central-1) via Vercel integration. All 6 Prisma migrations applied. Storage bucket configured with 5MB limit and JPEG/PNG/WebP restriction. | 2026-04-22 |
| — | Fix | Prisma config — switched from `env()` (broken in Prisma 7 for `migrate deploy`) to `dotenv/config` import + `process.env.DIRECT_URL` fallback. Migrations now work reliably. | 2026-04-22 |
| — | Fix | SSL fix for `pg` Pool — Supabase requires SSL but `pg` library doesn't parse `sslmode` from connection string. Added explicit `ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }` to Pool constructor. | 2026-04-22 |

### Sprint 20 — Follow-Up Jobs + Installation Date Checkbox (2026-04-21)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 27 | Feature | Follow-up jobs (Nachfolgeaufträge) — `FollowUpJob` model tied to `CustomerSystem` with optional `Maintenance` back-reference. CRUD API routes, React Query hook. `FollowUpSection` on system detail page with inline add + toggle complete + delete. Follow-up creation in `MaintenanceChecklistModal` Step 2. Amber badge with open count on customer detail page system cards. | 2026-04-21 |
| 32 | Feature | Installation date = maintenance date checkbox — checkbox in `SystemAssignmentModal` copies installation date to last maintenance date field. Syncs on date change, disables field when active, restores on uncheck. Pure client-side logic. | 2026-04-21 |

### Sprint 19 — Email Rework: Weekly Summary + Editable Templates (2026-04-21)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 13 | Email | Weekly summary rethink — replaced stat-block layout with actionable section-based email: bookings this week (green), due but unbooked (amber), overdue (red), retro last week (gray), totals. 7 parallel queries, 10-item list limits with overflow. | 2026-04-21 |
| 40 | Feature | Editable email templates — `reminderGreeting` and `reminderBody` fields on User model. Placeholder `{customerName}` support. "E-Mail-Vorlage" card on account page. Empty = use defaults. | 2026-04-21 |
| 2 | Email | Email deliverability — GMX junk issue resolved. DMARC no longer necessary. | 2026-04-21 |
| — | Docs | Comprehensive email system documentation written to `docs/EMAIL-SYSTEM.md` — covers all email types, cron jobs, opt-in flow, template architecture, configuration. | 2026-04-21 |

### Sprint 18 — Digital Maintenance Checklist (2026-04-21)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 35 | Feature | Digital maintenance checklist — 3-step `MaintenanceChecklistModal` (checklist → notes/photos → confirm). Per-system-type defaults (HEATING 10, AC 7, WATER_TREATMENT 6, ENERGY_STORAGE 6 items). `CustomerSystemChecklistItem` model for custom items per system. Immutable JSON snapshot on `Maintenance.checklistData`. API routes for checklist items CRUD. Integrated into system detail, customer detail, and dashboard pages. | 2026-04-21 |

### Sprint 17 — Quick Wins: Security, Dashboard Bookings, Email Log (2026-04-21)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 47 | Security | Photo upload route now verifies `maintenanceId` ownership (`prisma.maintenance.findFirst({ where: { id, userId } })`) and scopes storage path to `{userId}/maintenances/{id}-{ts}.ext`. | 2026-04-21 |
| 10 | Feature | Dashboard "Gebuchte Termine" section — shows all upcoming CONFIRMED bookings with customer name, system label, date/time. Uses existing `useBookings()` hook. | 2026-04-21 |
| 36 | Feature | Email log card on customer detail page — `GET /api/customers/[id]/email-logs` route + `useCustomerEmailLogs` hook. Shows up to 30 sent emails with type label (German), date/time, error indicator. Hidden when no logs exist. | 2026-04-21 |

### Sprint 16 — Multi-Tenancy Architecture Decision (2026-04-21)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 15 | Decision | Shared-database, single-schema multi-tenancy confirmed. Isolation via `userId` scoping in application code. No RLS (incompatible with Prisma+NextAuth without significant complexity). Tenant isolation rule added to CLAUDE.md. Full decision record in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-21-multi-tenancy-design.md`. Re-evaluation triggers documented. | 2026-04-21 |

### Sprint 15 — Office-Side Booking (2026-04-21)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 38 | Feature | Office-side booking via BookingFormModal on system detail page. POST /api/bookings creates Booking with BOOKING_MANUAL trigger, auto-links customer. Sends BookingConfirmationEmail (German) if customer has email; fire-and-forget, non-blocking. | 2026-04-21 |

### Sprint 14 — Terminiert Badge + Booked Slot Display (2026-04-21)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 20 | Feature | Green "Terminiert" badge on system cards when a future CONFIRMED booking exists. Replaces urgency badge when booked. | 2026-04-21 |
| 24 | UX | Booked slot (date + time) replaces "Nächste Wartung" line on system card when booking exists. System detail page shows "Gebuchter Termin" row in Wartungsplan card. | 2026-04-21 |

### Sprint 13 — Booking ↔ System Link (2026-04-21)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 23 | Feature | `systemId` FK added to `Booking` model. Cal.com reminder URLs now embed `metadata[systemId]`. Webhook resolves and validates `systemId` against user scope before storing. `GET /api/bookings` returns system + catalog info. Unblocks #24 and #20. | 2026-04-21 |

### Sprint 12 — Email Copy Fix (2026-04-20)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 39 | Email | Reminder email rephrased — wording now correctly states "last maintenance was X weeks ago, time to rebook" instead of implying a booked appointment is approaching. Card label changed from "Geplanter Wartungstermin" → "Wartung fällig ab". | 2026-04-20 |

### Sprint 11 — System Model Overhaul (2026-04-20)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 28 | Decision | Heater model: chose **Option A** — global `SystemCatalog` + per-tenant `CustomerSystem` instances. Catalog is shared across users; customer assignment is per-tenant with `userId` scoping. | 2026-04-20 |
| 29 | Feature | Renamed "Heizsysteme" → "Systeme". New `SystemCatalog` (global) + `CustomerSystem` (per-tenant) models. Top-level type selector: Heizung / Klimaanlage / Wasseraufbereitung / Energiespeicher. `SystemAssignmentModal` with `SystemTypeSelector` + `CatalogPicker` (search, grouped by manufacturer, inline add). Catalog seeded with 224 heating entries. New `/dashboard/systems` list page + `/dashboard/systems/[id]` detail page. | 2026-04-20 |
| 30 | Feature | AC subtypes — `AcSubtype` enum (SINGLE_SPLIT, MULTI_SPLIT_2/3/4/5) added to schema and `catalogCreateSchema`. | 2026-04-20 |
| 31 | Feature | Energy storage subtypes — `StorageSubtype` enum (BOILER, BUFFER_TANK) and `storageCapacityLiters` field added to `CustomerSystem`. | 2026-04-20 |
| 46 | Cleanup | Old `heatingType` / `additionalEnergySources` / `energyStorageSystems` fields removed from `Customer` model and all forms. Old `Heater` model, `useHeaters` hook, `HeaterFormModal`, `heater-form/` components, `api/heaters/`, `api/heating-systems/`, `dashboard/heaters/` all deleted. | 2026-04-20 |

### Sprint 10 — Admin Panel (2026-04-17)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 7 | Feature | Platform admin panel at `/admin` — gated by `ADMIN_EMAILS` env var. Read-only.

Admin button in account page visible only to admin users. | 2026-04-17 |

### Sprint 9 — Cal.com E2E + Bug Fixes (2026-04-16)

| # | Area | Description | Resolved |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 18 | Bug | Photo uploader fixed — client-side anon key rejected by Supabase RLS (no Supabase session via NextAuth). Moved to server-side `POST /api/upload/photo` using `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. | 2026-04-16 |
| 21a | Email | "Wartungstermin" label renamed to "Geplanter Wartungstermin" in reminder email template. | 2026-04-16 |

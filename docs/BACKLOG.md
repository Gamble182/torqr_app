## Open Items

### System Model — Follow-up

| # | Area | Description | Priority | Found |
|---|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 32 | Feature | Installation date = maintenance date checkbox — when assigning a system, checkbox "Installationsdatum als Wartungsdatum übernehmen" sets first maintenance interval to installation date + 1 year. | Medium | 2026-04-16 |
| 34 | Feature | Photos per system — allow attaching up to 5 photos per system directly in system detail view (e.g. installation photos for quoting). | Medium | 2026-04-16 |

### Cal.com Booking Integration

Booking is functional (webhook + customer resolution), but not yet linked to specific heaters. This group closes the loop: booking → heater → status badge → calendar.

| # | Area | Description | Priority | Found |
|---|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 23 | Feature | Link booking to specific system — pass `systemId` in Cal.com URL metadata, store on Booking model, resolve in webhook handler. Prerequisite for #24 and #20. | High | 2026-04-16 |
| 24 | UX | Show booked appointment on system card — once booking↔system link exists (#23), replace or augment "Nächste Wartung" date with actual booked slot (date + time). | Medium | 2026-04-16 |
| 20 | Feature | "Terminiert" status badge — show on system cards that have a linked future Cal.com booking. Depends on #23. | Medium | 2026-04-15 |
| 33 | Feature | Multi-system booking — if a customer has multiple systems with the same maintenance interval, allow selecting all for a single appointment. | Medium | 2026-04-16 |
| 38 | Feature | Office-side appointment booking — allow office staff to book on behalf of a customer (for customers without email, e.g. elderly). Bypass email-based Cal.com flow. | High | 2026-04-16 |

### Cal.com Configuration

These are mostly Cal.com dashboard settings, not code changes. Can be done in one sitting.

| # | Area | Description | Priority | Found |
|---|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 41 | Config | Business hours — configure booking availability (e.g. Mon–Thu 08:00–17:00) in Cal.com event settings. | Medium | 2026-04-16 |
| 42 | Config | Time slots per system type — different appointment durations per system type (Wärmepumpe, Gas, Öl, etc.). May require multiple Cal.com event types or app-side logic. | Medium | 2026-04-16 |
| 43 | Config | Booking location — currently shows "Online Call". Should show technician name or physical address. Cal.com event settings change. | Low | 2026-04-16 |
| 44 | Config | Target email — booking confirmation should go to business address, not personal. Cal.com settings change. | Low | 2026-04-16 |
| 45 | Config | Cancellation flow — verify Cal.com cancellation link is included in confirmation email so customers can cancel directly. | Low | 2026-04-16 |
| 11 | Decision | Calendar integration strategy — recommendation: do NOT build own calendar. Use Cal.com for scheduling, let users sync to Google/Outlook via Cal.com. Embed iframe if needed later. | Low | 2026-04-14 |

### Email System

| # | Area | Description | Priority | Found |
|---|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 39 | Email | Rephrase reminder email — current wording implies appointment is in one week. Correct meaning: "In one week it will have been a year since your last maintenance — please book." Copy must be updated. | High | 2026-04-16 |
| 2 | Email | Email deliverability — weekly summary and reminders land in GMX junk. Domain reputation improves over time; consider adding DMARC record to accelerate. | Medium | 2026-04-14 |
| 13 | Email | Weekly summary content refinement — review copy, structure, and data shown. Account page is now live, so this is unblocked. | Medium | 2026-04-15 |
| 40 | Feature | Editable email templates — allow users to customize reminder email text in app settings. Reference: Tooltime template from pilot customer. | Medium | 2026-04-16 |
| 36 | Feature | Email log in customer file — show list of all sent emails per customer with timestamps, directly in customer detail view. | Medium | 2026-04-16 |

### Field Service & Mobile

Features for technicians working on-site. The digital checklist (#35) is a key differentiator.

| # | Area | Description | Priority | Found |
|---|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 35 | Feature | Digital maintenance checklist — technicians fill out a per-system-type checklist during maintenance, check off items on mobile, sign digitally. Acts as digital Arbeitsbericht. | High | 2026-04-16 |
| 27 | Feature | Follow-up jobs (Nachfolgeaufträge) — section/tab for tasks discovered during maintenance (e.g. "Wasserfilter erneuern", "Angebot Klimaanlage"). Checkable items, photo attachments for quoting. | Medium | 2026-04-16 |

### Workforce & Scheduling

Relevant once multiple employees are on the platform.

| # | Area | Description | Priority | Found |
|---|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 26 | Feature | Employee management — "Mitarbeiter" tab. Create/delete employees. Show weekly maintenance count per employee and historical workload. | Medium | 2026-04-16 |
| 37 | Feature | Technician calendar view — which technician has appointments when. Admin can enter vacation / sick days. Sick day triggers automated rebook email to affected customers. | Medium | 2026-04-16 |

### Data Import

| # | Area | Description | Priority | Found |
|---|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 25 | Feature | CSV/Excel customer import — import customers from external tools (e.g. Tooltime export). Map columns to Customer model fields. | Medium | 2026-04-16 |

### Architecture & Account

| # | Area | Description | Priority | Found |
|---|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 15 | Decision | Multi-tenancy model — evaluate shared database with logical separation (per-user `userId` scoping, current approach) vs. separate schemas/databases per tenant. Produce architecture recommendation. | High | 2026-04-15 |
| 14 | Feature | Delete account / danger zone — allow user to delete own account and all associated data. Confirmation dialog. Add to account page settings. | Low | 2026-04-15 |

### Bookkeeping

| # | Area | Description | Priority | Found |
|---|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 10 | Feature | Booking feed / news section — show booked appointments in dashboard as "Gebuchte Termine". Partially covered by existing Cal.com bookings section on customer detail; dashboard-level view still missing. | Medium | 2026-04-14 |
